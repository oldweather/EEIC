\begin{document}
\maketitle

This is a summary of the progress of the East-India Company digitisation work: a collection of diagnostics for the new observations produced. I plan to update this document with each new batch of data digitised, and to add additional diagnostics and analyses [suggestions welcome]. About 900 logbooks containing instrumental weather observations were imaged and are being digitised. 784 have been digitised so far. The data so far cover 1788 to 1834 and come from 233 different ships.

[Temperatures are more common that pressures in the earlier voyages - I'd have thought pressures would be more important, but perhaps thermometers were cheaper]. Only one log so far has many sea temperature observations (The Thomas Grenville in 1827--8).}

Coloured points are the daily (noon) positions and weather observations recorded in the logbook, black lines show the expected values from 1961--90 climatologies for a ship following the same route at the same time of year. [AT expected high as it's a noon observation, big scatter in the pressure not surprising, wind speeds look promising, though beaufort quantisation makes them hard to compare].}

[Still some uncorrected positional errors - and the odd maverick: the voyage going round Australia is a convoy in 1804/5 - sent that way to avoid a French squadron in the Indian Ocean. The best route out and back is obviously prety well agreed on, except in the Indian Ocean on the way out, where the choices made by the Astell (figure \ref{astell} and Thomas Grenville (figure \ref{thomas_grenville}) both have adherents.]}

This figure shows the relative frequency of the more common terms (all those that occur at least 10 times). Translatable terms are marked by black dots (and have the equivalent Beaufort force included in the label), terms not in the CLIWOC dictionary are marked by grey dots. [Encouraging - most records are translatable, but little obvious scope for improvement - not many frequent terms we could reasonably hope to translate. We only get wind-force terms from about half the log pages.]}

I was looking for indications of the reliability of the CLIWOC dictionary for the EIC obs., but I don't think this helps much - the climatological variation is too small a fraction of the total variability in wind speed. Need to compare with the ERA instantaneous winds, but that's a lot of work.]}
